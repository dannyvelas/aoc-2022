# aoc-2022

My [AOC 2022](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in Clojure.

## Usage

`lein with-profile day<n>-part<k> run`

Where `<n>` corresponds to the day in December when the problem came out. And, `<k>` corresponds to the part.

Example: `lein with-profile day1-part2 run`.

It'd probably be best to set up your Clojure IDE environment and evaluate my solutions there though. Sometimes I forget to actually print the answers since I evaluate everything from within my own IDE (nvim).
